            <h1>Getting Started With Fan Accounts!</h1>
            <h2>Choosing Your Platform</h2>
            <p>The most common platforms to post edits on are TikTok and Instagram, and I suggest you post on <strong>both</strong> to reach a broader audience.</p>

        <div class="one">
            <h2>Setting Up Your Account</h2>
            <p>I suggest to create a separate email to make an account with. <br> When creating a username, you can approach it one of 3 ways:</p>
            <ul id="abc">
                <li>A) Using names related to the Fandom you'll be editing for,</li>
                <li>B) Using your own name,</li>
                <li>C) Or using a random name that has nothing to do with A or B.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you're stuck, you can find username ideas on <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=username%20ideas&rs=ac&len=2&source_id=cTkEAO0r&eq=us&etslf=4891">Pinterest</a>, or even ask generative AI to make one up for you!</p>
            <h2>Who to follow?</h2>
            <p>Of course, you can follow whoever you'd like to! But make sure to follow other editors (in the same Fandom as you and other Fandoms you're interested in), as well as audio and scene pack accounts. <br> You also want to be really active on these accounts (liking and commenting), especially on mutuals' accounts, to make your presence known.</p>
            <h2>Posting!</h2>
            <p>You want to post as much as you can in the beginning then create a posting schedule once you've gained some more following. <br> At that point, you'll be able to analyze your account analytics and determine when your followers are most active.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="one">
            <h2>Captions & Hashtags</h2>
            <p>In the captions of your edits, you want to have some interactive, fun statement to engage with your audience, as well as credits to other accounts if you used their work (audios, scene packs, presets, etc.)</p>
            <p>Next, you want to include <em>many</em> hashtags, using the algorithm to help get your edit seen.<br> The main hashtags you want are #fyp (for you page) and #edit(s), and the other ones should relate to whatever show or movie you edited.</p>
